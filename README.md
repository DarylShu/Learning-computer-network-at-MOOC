Learning computer network at MOOC-HIT

As a new graduate student in NYU Tandon, this semester I take the course-Internet Architecture and Protocols, which is a core course that requires GPA3.0 to pass.

After the Midterm exam, with a total points 106, I just got 49. The midterm point occupied 25% in the total points. So, it means I should do better in Lab, quiz and Final exam to raise my total points.

To this result, after reflecting on myself, it is sure that I didn't make enough effort to study. So, the bad result came.

In order to pass this course, I choose to concentrate more on my study. And I will learn this course both in MOOC and NYU class.

There is a lot of pressure, but there is no other way...
